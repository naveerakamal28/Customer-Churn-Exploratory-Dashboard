# **Customer Churn and Risk Analysis Dashboard**

### **Project Overview**

This dashboard was developed as part of a PwC assignment using the Power BI tool. The primary objective of this project is to analyze and provide insights into customer churn and customer risk to help identify patterns, risks, and trends in customer behavior. The dashboard consolidates various metrics and visualizations, offering a comprehensive view to aid decision-making.

### **Features**

*  **Customer Churn Analysis:**
Visual representation of customer churn rates.
Identification of factors contributing to churn.
Segmentation of customers by churn risk (e.g., low, medium, high risk).

* **Customer Risk Analysis:** Risk scoring based on key metrics (e.g., transaction history, engagement levels).
Visual breakdown of high-risk vs. low-risk customers.
Predictive analysis for potential future churn.

### **Data Sources**

* **Customer Data:** Includes demographic information, purchase history, transaction details, and engagement metrics.
* **Risk Assessment Metrics:** Various calculated fields that quantify customer risk based on behavior patterns and transactional data.

### **Visualizations**

* **Churn Rate Trend:** Displays historical churn data and trends over time.
* **Risk Segmentation:** Pie charts and bar graphs visualizing customer distribution across different risk categories.
* **Churn Prediction:** Predictive model output showing potential future churn.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Metrics for tracking churn rate, customer lifetime value, and other relevant KPIs.

### **Usage**

* **Open the Dashboard:** Launch the Power BI dashboard file.
* **Navigate Between Tabs:** Use the tabs to switch between different sections like churn analysis, risk breakdown, and predictive insights.
* **Filter and Drill Down:** Apply filters (e.g., region, product, customer segment) to view specific data.
* **Interpret Insights:** Analyze the data to identify patterns, risks, and opportunities for customer retention strategies.

### **Tools & Technologies**

* **Power BI:** For data visualization and reporting.
* **Data Sources:** Excel and CSV files (customer data, transactional data).

### **How to Run the Project**

* Install Power BI Desktop if not already installed.
* Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
* Ensure all data connections are properly established.
* Interact with the visualizations to explore the data and insights.

### **Future Enhancements**

* Integration of real-time data for up-to-the-minute churn tracking.
* Further enhancement of predictive models for churn prevention.
* Additional insights into customer lifetime value (CLV) and customer engagement.
